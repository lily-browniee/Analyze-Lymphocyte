### Lymphocytes:
Lymphocytes are one of the body's main types of immune cells. They are made in the bone marrow and found in the blood and lymph tissue. Lymphocytes work together to defend the body against foreign substances, such as bacteria, viruses, and cancer cells that can threaten its functioning. There are two categories of lymphocytes known as B cells and T cells both are originated from stem cells in the bone marrow.
